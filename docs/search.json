    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent years, the decline in fertility rates has become a pronounced pattern observed globally, and experts from various domains, from sociology to economics, are trying to discover the reason behind this phenomenon. This project aims to explore potential factors influencing this trend, including marriage rates, divorce rates, educational attainment, and economical factors like GDP (gross domestic product). Since the trend is observed globally, the scope of our project also includes multiple countries, like the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the decline. By investigating these factors, we hope to uncover meaningful insights into the relationship between the societal structure and individual choices.",

For OECD, UN, and Eurostat, they are responsible for the data collection and the data is collected from administrative data sources, such as civil registration and population and housing censuses. For the World Bank Group, they collect data by compiling from officially-recognized international sources. All of the data are either csv files or excel files. Data from OECD, UN, and Eurostat is updated annually, while the data from the World Bank group is updated quarterly. The dimensions for data collected from Eurostat, UN, OECD, and the World Bank group are 52 rows and 13 columns, 322 rows and 22 columns, 55 rows and 64 columns, and 68 columns and 397,936 rows, respectively. The main issue we have for the data is about organization. Since the data we have collected are pulled from multiple sources, it is rather hard to integrate these data into one file since each data has a different format and contains diverse information. Thus, organizing the data into suitable format for processing is a challenge for us. Lastly, our plan on importing the data is to download the files from the official website first, then transform them into the same format using Excel, and import the transformed files in R for further processing and analysis at last.\nLinks to our data sources:\nhttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/products/dyb/#statistics\nhttps://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/oecd-family-database.html\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database\nhttps://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators"

For non-rich countries the data is sparse, so we currently choosing some specific countries for analyzing. The total sum of missing values in divorce rate data set is 100, the total sum of missing values in marriage rate data set is 0.

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data for marriage and divorce rates we are using are pulled together from multiple data sources, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), United Nations (UN), and Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat). The data for marriage and divorce rates from all these sources are collected from administrative data sources, including civil registration, population and housing censuses, and statistical reports or administrative records on marriages and divorces. The data is collected by the sources themselves. Another dataset we plan to use is the World Development Indicators, which includes a comprehensive collection of relevant variables alongside fertility rates, such as GDP, educational attainment, life expectancy, etc. Maintained by the World Bank, it is compiled from officially recognized international sources, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. The dataset provides valuable insights into a wide range of development topics, including economic performance, education, health, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability, serving as a critical resource for policymakers, researchers, and analysts.\nFor marriage and divorce rates, these data are either csv files or excel files with annual updates. The dimension for the marriage and divorce rates collected from Eurostat contains 52 rows and 13 columns, 53 rows and 13 columns, respectively. The divorce rates data collected from the UN has 322 rows and 22 columns. The marriage and divorce rates data collected from OECD both contain 55 rows and 64 columns. The World Development Indicators dataset consists of CSV files that are updated quarterly in April, July, September, and December. The dataset contains 68 columns and 397,936 rows.\nThe main issue we have for the data is about organization. Since the data we have collected are pulled from multiple sources, it is rather hard to integrate these data into one file since each data has a different format and contains diverse information. Thus, organizing the data together is a big challenge for us as we not only need to filter out the information that is shared or complimentary among these datasets but also need to align the format in each dataset before merging them together for further analysis. Another issue is about the World Development Indicators dataset, which is a comprehensive dataset containing information that is irrelevant to our project. Thus, we need to select and filter out irrelevant features that are unlikely to significantly influence the topic we are focusing on, such as access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking or external health expenditure.\nOur plan on importing the data is to download the files from the official website first. After downloading the data, we will first perform some data preprocessing using Excel to ensure that data is in the correct format that can be processed by R. When the data is converted into the suitable format, we will import them in R for further processing and analysis.\nLinks to our data sources:\nhttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/products/dyb/#statistics\nhttps://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/oecd-family-database.html\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database\nhttps://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators",
