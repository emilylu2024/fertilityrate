    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent years, the decline in fertility rates has become a pronounced pattern observed globally, and experts from various domains, from sociology to economics, are trying to discover the reason behind this phenomenon. This project aims to explore how economic and societal factors influence the global decline in fertility rates. The factors of our interest include life expectancy, marriage rates, divorce rates, educational attainment, and GDP (gross domestic product) growth. Since the trend is observed globally, the scope of our project also includes multiple countries, like the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the decline. By investigating these factors, we hope to uncover meaningful insights into the relationship between the societal structure and individual choices."

For OECD, UN, and Eurostat, they are responsible for the data collection and the data is collected from administrative data sources, such as civil registration and population and housing censuses. For the World Bank Group, they collect data by compiling from officially-recognized international sources. All of the data are either csv files or excel files. Data from OECD, UN, and Eurostat is updated annually, while the data from the World Bank group is updated quarterly. The dimensions for data collected from Eurostat, UN, OECD, and the World Bank group are 52 rows and 13 columns, 322 rows and 22 columns, 55 rows and 64 columns, and 68 columns and 397,936 rows, respectively. The main issue we have for the data is about organization. Since the data we have collected are pulled from multiple sources, it is rather hard to integrate these data into one file since each data has a different format and contains diverse information. Thus, organizing the data into suitable format for processing is a challenge for us. Lastly, our plan on importing the data is to download the files from the official website first, then transform them into the same format using Excel, and import the transformed files in R for further processing and analysis at last.\nLinks to our data sources:\nhttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/products/dyb/#statistics\nhttps://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/oecd-family-database.html\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database\nhttps://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators"

As shown in the above plot, South Korea and Turkey has most missing value in life expectancy, gender, gdp, fertility rate, educational attainment, education level and divorce rate. For Year, MarriageRate, and Code, these variables show mostly purple cells, indicating that data is well-recorded with minimal or no missing values across all countries. For educational_attainment and education_level, they have a significant amount of missing data across many countries (as evident by the green and yellow cells). There is a mix of purple (no missing values) and green/yellow in divorce rate, indicating inconsistent data collection across countries."

There’s a positive correlation between marriage and divorce rates, as shown by the red trend line with its gray confidence interval band. Marriage rates range from about 2 to 10, while divorce rates range from 0 to about 5. The data points show considerable spread around the trend line, suggesting that while there is a correlation, it’s not a perfect relationship. There appears to be more variability in divorce rates when marriage rates are between 4-6, creating a wider “band” of points in this region. At higher marriage rates (8-10), the data points seem to follow the trend line more closely, though there are some notable outliers, particularly at the highest marriage rates where some points show significantly lower divorce rates than the trend would predict.",

Countries such as Norway and Singapore experienced relatively small declines in fertility and nuptiality. Marriage rates have remained relatively stable compared with fertility in many countries. Countries such as Singapore and the United States show clear trends, with marriage rates stabilizing at lower levels. Taken together, both the marriage rate and the fertility rate show a downward trend in different countries, and in some countries (Ireland, United Kingdom), the marriage rate and the fertility rate seem to be correlated because the trends and shapes of the two lines are similar."

Marriage Rate and Divorce Rate are highly positively correlated, indicating that higher marriage rates are associated with higher divorce rates. Marriage Rate and fertility rate also has high correlation. Fertility rate is negatively correlated with Year, which aligns with global trends where fertility rates decrease with higher education and over time. It is surprising that the fertility rate is negatively correlated with life expectancy. GDP growth has weaker correlations with most variables, suggesting it does not strongly align with the other variables in this data set. This heatmap provides a useful overview for identifying patterns and relationships within the data."

It appears that regions with higher fertility rates (colored in blue) have diminished over the decades. On the other hand, areas with a lower fertility rate (colored in red) have increased significantly over the decades, expanding across Europe, the Americas, and parts of Asia. This trend reflects a global shift toward a lower fertility rate, which might be driven by improvements in education, healthcare, and economics.\nThe shape file used to make this graph is obtained from the link shown below: https://www.geoboundaries.org/globalDownloads.html"

The y-axis displays the scaled value for these two variables because of the differences in their measuring units. Over the decades, fertility rates have shown a consistent declining trend. On the other hand, GDP growth has fluctuated over the years, revealing periods of economic growth and recessions, with two noticeable drops around 2010 and 2020, when global crises like the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic happened. The steady decline in fertility rates with the fluctuation shown in GDP growth rate indicates that the changes in fertility rate are independent of the variations in the country’s economic health."

The values of both variables are scaled to avoid bias in comparison. While the visualization exhibits a steady trend of increasing life expectancy, marriage rates have been consistently decreasing across the years. Despite the rate and the extent of changes vary by country, the overall trend is shared globally, which could be one of the factors influencing family structures and leading to changes in the fertility rate."

Fertility rate shows a negative correlation with Year, reflecting the global trend of decreasing fertility rates over time. There’s an unexpected negative correlation between fertility rate and life expectancy. GDP growth shows weak correlations with most variables, indicating it may be less connected to demographic trends in this dataset."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Based on our exploration, we found that fertility rates decline when life expectancy and the percentage of educational attainment increase. On the other hand, fertility and marriage rates have a positive correlation as they both demonstrate a declining trend across the globe. To our surprise, changes in divorce rates and GDP growth seem to be independent of the changes in fertility rates. In our further investigation of these two variables, we find that divorce rates are positively correlated with the marriage rate, while GDP growth is independent of the changes in marriage rates. This finding indicates that societal factors are probably more influential to changes in marriage rates than economic factors. Due to the lack of data for low-income countries and earlier periods in educational attainment, our analysis is limited to the countries that have middle or high incomes and time after 2014, which restricts the scope of our findings and might contribute to the differences between correlation matrix result and the findings shown by our graph. In the future, we could focus more on the direction of educational attainment to improve the strength of the conclusion by including a broader range of data in our analysis. In summary, the global decline in the fertility rate is associated with the improvement in healthcare and education and the decline in the marriage rate."
