# Introduction

In recent years, the decline in fertility rates has become a pronounced pattern observed globally, and experts from various domains, from sociology to economics, are trying to discover the reason behind this phenomenon. This project aims to explore how economic and societal factors influence the global decline in fertility rates. The factors of our interest include life expectancy, marriage rates, divorce rates, educational attainment, and GDP (gross domestic product) growth. Since the trend is observed globally, the scope of our project also includes multiple countries, like the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the decline. By investigating these factors, we hope to uncover meaningful insights into the relationship between the societal structure and individual choices.
