This repo contains the final project for group 14. The topic for the final project is to analyze the influence of societal and economic factors on the decline of fertility rates. The variables explored in the project include divorce and marriage rates, GDP growth, life expectancy, and educational attainment. The analysis is performed through visualizations to investigate the reasons behind this declining trend. The data_raw folder contains the raw data collected for this project, and the data_clean folder contains the code used for data cleaning and the resulting data. Due to the size restriction, we are unable to upload the shape file folder we used to the GitHub repository. A compressed version is uploaded to a Google Drive and can be accessed with Lionmail through the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cUoFnWk-AF3InyhUs94ILsjRYikATYwE?usp=sharing. These files can also be found and downloaded from https://www.geoboundaries.org/globalDownloads.html, where the data is originally from.
