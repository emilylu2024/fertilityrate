This repo contains the final project for group 14. The topic for the final project is the decline of fertility rates, where we aim to explore variables, such as divorce and marraige rates, GDP, educational attainment, through visualizations to provide a comprehensive analysis on the reasons behind this declining trend. The data_raw folder contains the raw data collected for this project, and the data_clean folder contains the code used for data cleaning and the resulting data. Due to the size restriction, we are unable to upload the shape file folder we used for creating the map graphs, but it can be found and downloaded from from https://www.geoboundaries.org/globalDownloads.html.
