This repo contains the final project for group 14. The topic for the final project is the decline of fertility rates, where we aim to explore variables, such as divorce and marraige rates, GDP, educational attainment, through visualizations to provide a comprehensive analysis on the reasons behind this declining trend. The data_raw folder contains the raw data collected for this project, and the data_clean folder contains the code used for data cleaning and the resulting data. The geoBoundariesCGAZ_ADM0 is the compressed shape files used to create the map graph in results section. Due to the size resitrction, the files are uploaded to the repository in compressed form instead of folder.
